# Pull Request: Enhance Inference Analysis with ICD Status-Based Incidence Rate Analysis

## 🎯 Purpose
This PR modifies the `code.py` inference function to replace Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox proportional hazards models with a more clinically relevant analysis that compares high-risk vs low-risk groups based on ICD status and different endpoints.

## 🔄 Changes Made

### Removed:
- **KM plots**: Gender-specific survival analysis with Kaplan-Meier curves
- **Cox PH models**: Proportional hazards regression analysis
- **Gender-based grouping**: Analysis by Female/Male instead of ICD status

### Added:
- **ICD Group Analysis (ICD=1)**: 
  - Endpoint: "Appropriate ICD Therapy" (Primary Endpoint)
  - Compares high-risk vs low-risk groups
  - Calculates incidence rates for each risk group
  
- **No-ICD Group Analysis (ICD=0)**:
  - Endpoint: Mortality (Secondary Endpoint) 
  - Compares high-risk vs low-risk groups
  - Calculates incidence rates for each risk group

- **Statistical Analysis**:
  - Chi-square test for binary outcome comparison
  - Risk ratio calculations (High Risk / Low Risk)
  - Comprehensive risk group distribution summary

## 📊 New Analysis Output

The modified inference function now provides:

```
=== Risk Group Analysis by ICD Status ===

--- ICD Group Analysis (n=X) ---
Endpoint: Appropriate ICD Therapy
Low Risk Group (n=X): X events, Incidence Rate: X.XXXX
High Risk Group (n=X): X events, Incidence Rate: X.XXXX
Chi-square test p-value: X.XXXXX
Risk Ratio (High/Low): X.XXX

--- No-ICD Group Analysis (n=X) ---
Endpoint: Mortality (Secondary Endpoint)
Low Risk Group (n=X): X events, Incidence Rate: X.XXXX
High Risk Group (n=X): X events, Incidence Rate: X.XXXX
Chi-square test p-value: X.XXXXX
Risk Ratio (High/Low): X.XXX

=== Overall Summary ===
Total test samples: X
ICD group: X
No-ICD group: X

Risk Group Distribution:
  Low Risk: X
  High Risk: X
```

## 🏗️ Maintained Functionality

The following features remain unchanged:
- ✅ Sex-specific model training (male/female separate models)
- ✅ Feature importance analysis and visualization
- ✅ Clustering analysis (without visualization)
- ✅ Bootstrap evaluation
- ✅ All other existing functionality

## 🎯 Clinical Relevance

This modification addresses the specific research question:
> "Do the model-determined high-risk and low-risk groups have significantly different incidence rates?"

By analyzing:
1. **ICD patients**: Whether they receive appropriate ICD therapy
2. **Non-ICD patients**: Whether they experience mortality events

This provides more direct clinical insights than survival analysis, especially for binary outcomes.

## 📁 Files Modified

- **`code.py`**: Modified `full_model_inference()` function
- **`main.py`**: **No changes** (kept original functionality)

## 🧪 Testing

The modified function has been tested to ensure:
- Proper handling of empty ICD/no-ICD groups
- Correct calculation of incidence rates
- Valid statistical test execution
- Proper error handling for edge cases

## 🔍 Code Quality

- Added comprehensive error handling
- Maintained consistent code style
- Added detailed inline documentation
- Preserved all existing functionality
- No breaking changes to function signature

## 📝 Summary

This PR transforms the inference analysis from survival-based visualization to clinically-focused incidence rate comparison, providing more actionable insights for clinical decision-making while maintaining all existing model training and evaluation capabilities.
